<h2 id="spain">Spain</h2>
<p>...Yesterday,<br /> just a photograph of yesterday.<br />
And all it's edges folded and the corners faded, sepia brown.<br />
And yet it's all I have of our past love.<br />
A postscript to it's ending.<br /><br />
Brighter days,<br />
I can see such brighter days.<br />
When every song we sang is sung again.<br />
And now we know it's for good.<br />
This time for good.<br />
And we're lovers once again.<br />
And you're near me.<br /><br />
I can remember the rain in December.<br />
The leaves are brown on the ground.<br /><br />
In Spain I did love and adore you.<br />
The nights filled with joy, were our yesterdays,<br />
And tomorrow will bring you near me.<br /><br />
I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire.<br />
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays.<br />
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime I see<br />
That Spain again.<br /><br />
I can remember the rain in December.<br />
The leaves are brown on the ground.<br />
Our love was a Spanish fiesta.<br />
The bright lights and songs were our joy each day.<br />
And the nights were the heat of yearning.<br />
I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire.<br />
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays.<br />
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime I see<br />
You gaze at me.<br /><br />
I see moments of history.<br />
Your eyes meet mine.<br />
And they dance to the melody.<br />
And we live again, as if dreaming.<br />
The sound of our hearts beat like castanets.<br />
And forever we know their meaning...<br /><br /><br />
Chick Corea

        <p>...Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while.<br />
        Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies.<br />
        We don't have the power, but we never say never.<br />
        Let us die young or let us live forever.<br />
        Forever young, Forever young.<br />
        Youth's like diamonds in the sun,<br />
        And diamonds are forever.<br />
        Some are like water, some are like the heat.<br />
        Some are a melody and some are the beat(POP).<br />
        Sooner or later, we all will be gone.<br />
        Why don't we stay young!?<br />
        Forever young, Forever young.<br />
        Youth's like diamonds in the sun,<br />
        And diamonds are forever.<br />
        So many adventures given up today.<br />
        So many songs we forgot to play.<br />
        So many dreams swinging out of the blue.<br />
        Pop...How I miss You...<br />
        But we don't get to choose,<br />
        the music's played by the madman.<br />
        Forever young, Forever young.<br />
        Youth's like diamonds in the sun,<br />
        And diamonds are forever.<br />
        Pop...How I miss You...<br />
